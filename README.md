Note: Live deployment is pending

CryptKeeper is a Progressive Web Application that displays a crypto currency dashboard of the top 100 crypto currencies sorted by market cap.  The app allows the user to view trend data of each coin as well as build portfolios to track investments. The app makes live API calls everytime data is requested and makes sure that the user is presented with the most updated information.  Please see short demo below.
